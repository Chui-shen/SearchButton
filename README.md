# SearchButton

An HTML tag definition of my search tag.

## Why?
Because most of us do not want to bother with someone asking stupid questions, we would like to throw him 

**A BIG BUTTON THAT WILL TAKE HIM IMMEDIATELY TO THE SEARCH ENGINE**.

like this:

![Search "What is CMD?"](https://github.com/Lafcadia/SearchButton/assets/147896059/98e6dc4c-3c41-4a0c-ae42-ba699000cfde)

By writing `<search type="google" content="What is CMD?" newWindow="True"></search>`

## Usage

It's very simple.

Example:

```html
<search type="baidu" content="12" newWindow="true"></search>
```

It will show us a button. A new tab will appear by clicking the button, and it will search 12 in Baidu Search Engine.

It also supports Bing, Yandex, Sogou, 360(S360) and GitHub.

## Special Thanks

Fgaoxing's Pandown-js gave me a flash of inspiration.
